I should probably lock that.
Dude. Not cool.
We'll just call that a loan.
You're paying me back for that later. Whether you like it or not.
Yes, by all means. Rob my store in front of me.
Hey. Come on.
Stop stealing from me!
Supply and demand, bitches!
Come back anytime!
Farewell, friend!
I'm sure we'll be doing this again soon enough!
tell your friends: Marcus munitions!
Remember, we're always open!
Good luck!
Don't have TOO much fun!
Don't die, I need your business!
Two words, my friend: no refunds.
A pleasure as always!
Pleasure doing business!
May it help you kill many things!
You're my millionth customer! Don't let it get to your head.
Nothing like a good sale!
May it keep you safe in your travels!
Thanks for the scratch!
Nice to get back some of that money you stole from me.
Welcome to my humble shop!
Welcome, customer!
Let me know if anything catches your eye.
High quality, low prices, and no questions asked!
It's a fine day, full of opportunity!
A fantastic day for capitalism!
Feeling overburdened by money?
When you think "murder," think "Marcus muntions!"
I've always got new stock -- check back later!
I'll always buy guns you don't need!
Don't get killed!
I'm always happy to take your money!
Your cash ain't worth a thing if you don't spend it!
Check back later to see my new Weapon of the Day!
See you soon!
Always happy to do business with a Vault Hunter!
Tear the bad guys a new one, eh?
Later, Vault Hunter!
Capitalism, baby!
No refunds.
Tell your friends where you got that!
May it serve you well!
Now, make some holes!
That'll cause some pain!
Enjoy your new instrument of death!
Now get to killing!
Sad trombone!
You know you gotta give me some gear, right?
You didn't give me any gear? What's wrong with you?
Do you not get how this works? Gimme some gear!
You forgot to give me gear, dude.
You gotta give me something to work with!
Here you are!
Here is a gift, loyal customer!
I made this thing for you. Take it already.
I think you'll be very happy with this.
You deserve the best -- so here it is!
Loot doesn't get ANY better than that!
This is the best I have to offer!
You have pleased me VERY much!
That ain't enough money.
This ain't a charity!
The wise Marcus requires money. Go get some.
I can't do anything with those!
Thanks, but no thanks!
Buy a gun, already!
Guns! I've got them, you need them!
Guns, guns, guns!
Guns, glorious guns!
Lock and load!
You can never be too well-armed.
Catch-a-gun! Guh. Never doing that again.
